      <p>
        I am an ambitious software developer who has shown determination,
        proactivity, and tenacity to reach where I am today. My inspiration to
        work in technology is driven by the variety and constant challenge that
        this sector provides. I particularly enjoy the self learning aspect of
        coding. I am coming to the end of a year-long intensive, full-stack web
        development programme and am looking for a full-time developer position
        so I can bring my passion and skillset to bear in the workplace.
